                <h4>Background</h4>
                <p> Dinner for Two is an interactive installation made for an event titled "Sunsets" for the course
                    "Situated Instrument Design for Musical Expression" (Music158B in UC Berkeley). It is an exploratory project integrating sound, lights, sensors, and motion. </p>
                <p> The goal of this project is to provide a delightful and immersive experience for participants to share by the sunset.
                     </p>
                <p> I worked together with my classmate Everett on the ideation, design, and implementation for this project.</p>
                <h4>Features </h4>
                    <p class>When working on this project, we thought of ways we could amplify the experience of dinning by the sunset. </p>
                    <p class>Some features we integrated include:</p>
                    <li>A recording of the sun by NASA, which was processed at different frequencies to achieve melody and harmony. </li> 
                    <li>Snippets of the word sunset spoken in different languages around the world.</li>
                    <li>Samples of the clinking of silverware and the pouring of water, simulating the atmosphere of dinning.</li>
                    <li>Our installation placed outside, so participants can experience the sunset.</li>
                    <li>Edison lightbulbs increasing in brightness, as you motion closer to the lightbulb.</li>
                    <p class> Our approach included using audio samples, the environment and structures, devices to track motion, and Max MSP to interface with sensors and process data in real-time. </p>
                <h4>Outcomes</h4> 
                    <p>Performances between pairs of participants, who experiment with motion, velocity, and sound.</p>  
                    <p>From this project, I gained knowledge about creating an immersive physical experience. I also got to explore the relationship between movement, 
                        sound, visuals, and connect them back to our theme for the event. On the technical side, we handled real-time motion data using a gametrak controller and implemented automation with
                         Max MSP. </p>
